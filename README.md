# Project Description

### Problem  
Many small and medium-sized car shops face difficulties in managing their operations efficiently. Customers often struggle to schedule appointments online, browse available services, or check the status of their vehicles. On the shop side, tracking inventory, managing service history, and coordinating staff availability can be disorganized when relying on manual methods or outdated systems. This results in scheduling conflicts, customer dissatisfaction, and loss of potential business opportunities.  

### Solution  
Our project proposes a **modern web application for a car shop** that simplifies both customer and administrative interactions. The website will allow customers to book service appointments online, view detailed information about services offered, and receive updates on their carâ€™s status. Shop administrators will gain access to a secure dashboard to manage appointments, maintain customer records, and track inventory of car parts. The system will improve workflow efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing a seamless digital experience.  

### Technologies  
The solution will be built using a **Node.js** and **Express.js** back-end, with a **MongoDB** database for managing customers, appointments, and inventory. The **front-end** will be developed with **React** for a responsive and interactive user experience, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. Authentication and authorization will be handled with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to ensure security. The project will be hosted on **Heroku** (or a similar cloud service), with **GitHub** for version control and collaboration. Development will be supported using **Visual Studio Code**, **Postman** for API testing, and **Figma** for UI/UX design.
