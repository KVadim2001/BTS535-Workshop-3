# Project Charter  
### Car Shop Website  

---

## 1. Introduction  

This project aims to design and develop a full-featured **Car Shop Website** that simplifies interactions between customers and the shop. The platform will allow customers to book appointments, request maintenance, view their service history, and communicate directly with staff. On the administrative side, the system will enable staff to manage appointments, view inventory, assign jobs to mechanics, and track ongoing maintenance requests. The goal is to modernize the workflow of small and medium-sized car shops by providing an efficient and user-friendly digital system.

## 2. Overview (including Objectives)  

### Project Overview  
Many car shops still rely on phone calls, paper-based systems, and manual scheduling to manage daily operations. This often leads to scheduling conflicts, delays, and poor customer experience. The **Car Shop Website** will streamline these processes through an integrated online solution.  

### Objectives  
- Provide customers with the ability to **book, view, and manage appointments** online.  
- Enable administrators to **manage appointments and staff schedules** effectively.  
- Allow mechanics to **view assigned jobs and update their completion status**.  
- Securely store and manage **customer and vehicle information**.  
- Improve communication between customers, staff, and management through notifications and updates.
